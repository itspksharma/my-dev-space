    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      I'm <strong>Pawan Kumar Sharma</strong>, a passionate full-stack developer dedicated to building modern web applications with clean code and great performance.
      <br /><br />
      My journey began with curiosity and transformed into a career driven by a love for technology and problem-solving. I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and SEO-optimized websites using tools like React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Astro, and more.
      <br /><br />
      When I’m not coding, I’m usually learning something new, sharing knowledge, or working on meaningful side projects like <em>Just Download</em>.
