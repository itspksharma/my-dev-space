  "beyondCodingText": "Life isn’t just about code — I love exploring new places, discovering local food spots, and going on long bike or car rides to clear my head. I enjoy meeting people with fresh perspectives, learning new skills outside tech, and sometimes just getting lost in a journey with no fixed destination. These experiences inspire my creativity and keep my mind fresh for building better solutions."
